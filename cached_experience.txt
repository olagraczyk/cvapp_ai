2.2.    Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (Poland)
2.2.1.  	 Batchelor: Cognitive Science
Time: September 2021 – July 2024
Thesis was about:        	Conducted research and experiment with 40 people for my bachelor’s thesis on the interplay between human cognition and AI, investigating how AI can augment learning and cognitive functions.
Abstract: This work examines the impact of using artificial intelligence (AI) in the learning
process. The aim of the work is to compare the effectiveness of learning information contained
in a text using traditional methods and equivalent methods using artificial intelligence. An
empirical study was conducted with 40 students aged 15-22, who were divided into two groups:
self-chosen methods of learning and learning with additional materials created by ChatGPT.
The group studying with ChatGPT materials used generated notes, summaries, explanations,
test questions and flashcards. The study results did not show statistically significant differences
between learning effectiveness in both groups. Neither the use of materials generated by
ChatGPT, nor the learning methods used had a significant impact on knowledge test results.
However, it was noticed that longer learning time was associated with better results in the time-
spaced knowledge test. This research suggests that ChatGPT and other AI tools may not yet be
as effective in supporting learning as expected. The results require further research in a larger
and more diverse sample. It is also necessary to further develop AI tools to minimize the risk
of hallucinations and plagiarism. The work indicates the potential benefits of using AI to
generate learning aids that can increase motivation and facilitate preparation for learning.

Had an incredible weekend at Brainhack at Warsaw University! 🧠💡
I immersed myself in a community of great minds—people passionate about brain science, coding, and innovation, all coming from diverse backgrounds. Together, in a team of six, we built a mobile app for psychiatric care patients—from Figma prototypes to a working Flutter Flow app connected to Firebase.
This hackathon was a game-changer for me—I learned a new tool, applied my database knowledge, and gained UX/UI experience while working alongside a future doctor who provided key medical insights.
